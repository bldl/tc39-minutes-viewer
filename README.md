# ZINF-TC39

## About the project

We have been tasked with improving the accessibility and readability of the TC39 meeting notes. Our application simplifies the process of viewing these notes. We've organized all meeting documents into a tree structure, making it easier to find specific files. Additionally, we've incorporated a sentiment analysis tool. This feature allows users to select portions of text and analyze their sentiment. We've also integrated the ChatGPT API. Now, users can engage in conversations with context from the marked sections of the markdown (MD) files.
